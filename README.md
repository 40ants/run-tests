# GitHub Action to Run Tests for a Common Lisp Library

This is a Github Action can be used to run tests for any Common Lisp supporting `(asdf:test-system :my-system)`.

It should be used after the [setup-lisp][8de1] action.

<a id="x-28DOCS-2FDOCS-3A-3A-40FEATURES-2040ANTS-DOC-2FLOCATIVES-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## What this action does for you?

* It runs (asdf:test-system :the-system-name) by default.

* But you can provide your own lisp code.

* It automatically searches a test system name if it is present.

## A typical usage

Here is how a minimal GitHub Workflow might look like:

```yaml
name: 'CI'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - 'master'
  pull_request:

jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        lisp:
          - sbcl-bin
          - ccl-bin
          
    env:
      LISP: ${{ matrix.lisp }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: 40ants/setup-lisp@v1
        with:
          asdf-system: cl-info
      - uses: 40ants/run-tests@v2
        with:
          asdf-system: cl-info
```
The part, corresponding to an action call is:

```yaml
- uses: 40ants/run-tests@v2
  with:
    asdf-system: cl-info
```
Here we provided a system name `cl-info`, but
action is smart enough to detect that really
there is a separate `cl-info-test` `ASDF` system.

To guess a system name to run tests against, action
will check `${asdf-system}-test`, `${asdf-system}-tests`,
`${asdf-system}/test` and `${asdf-system}/tests`. And if none
of them found - fall back to `${asdf-system}`.

**Please, note, that `(asdf:test-system :your-system-name)`
should signal error in case if some tests were failed.** Only
in this case action will exit with error code.

## Custom test runner

Sometimes you might want to use something special instead of
`(asdf:test-system :your-system-name)`. You can pass any lisp
code to the action:

```
- uses: 40ants/run-tests@v2
  with:
    asdf-system: cl-info
    run-tests: |
      (ql:quickload :cl-info-test)

      (unless (rove:run :cl-info-test)
         (error "Tests failed"))
```
<a id="x-28DOCS-2FDOCS-3A-3A-40COVERALLS-2040ANTS-DOC-2FLOCATIVES-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## Publishing reports to Coveralls

This action automates coverage collection and reporting. To publish report
to the [Coveralls][b60c], pass your github token as
a `coveralls-token` argument:

```yaml
- uses: 40ants/run-tests@v2
  with:
    asdf-system: cl-info
    coveralls-token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
```
If you are using "matrix", then it is good idea to collect coverage report
only on one matrix combination. To do this, use a logical expression which
will check some variables and returns a token only if all of them are true:

```yaml
- uses: 40ants/run-tests@v2
  with:
    asdf-system: cl-info
    coveralls-token: |
      ${{ matrix.lisp == 'sbcl-bin' &&
          matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest' &&
          matrix.quicklisp-dist == 'ultralisp' &&
          secrets.github_token }}
```
Here is an example how your report on Coveralls can look like:

https://coveralls.io/github/40ants/cl-info

**Note**, that coverage reporting currently works only on `SBCL` and `CCL` 1.4.
You can contribute support for other implementations to
[cl-coveralls][9031].

<a id="x-28DOCS-2FDOCS-3A-3A-40ROADMAP-2040ANTS-DOC-2FLOCATIVES-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## Roadmap

* Support uploading code coverage reports to CodeCov.

* Vendor all dependencies, to make action more reliable and secure.
